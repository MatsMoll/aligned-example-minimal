# Aligned Example Minimal

This repo shows how Aligned can run with almost no code.

The repo will spin up the same architecture and features as the [Alinged Examples repo](https://github.com/MatsMoll/aligned-example).
We reference the compiled feature definitions from the examples repo, with URLs in `worker.py` and `server.py`. 
But we define the architecture we want to spin up here.

To start the whole architecture, run the following:
`docker compose up`
